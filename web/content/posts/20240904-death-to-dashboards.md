If I'm a senior manager/executive/whatever, I want a PDF in my email once a
month that explains: how things are going, what changed and why (did we do
something or did something happen to us), what are we doing that's going to make
things better, and how that links to our longer term goals. While I'm looking at
that, I might want to check back to last month's PDF and see if what you said
there was true. What I _don't_ want is to click some link to log in to a
dashboard, mess about with some filters and try understand what I'm looking
at---I want to be told. The charts are just a detail to me: I actually care
about the _analysis_ (the words on the page), not the pictures that I have to
interpret---they're only there to prove to me that your're making sense.
