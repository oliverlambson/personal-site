          Why I make carbon fibre guitars
        </h1>
        <p>
          The musical instrument industry is a tiny niche and the most popular
          electric guitar models are designs from the 1950’s. Why bother?
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s interesting, fun, and I want to. The rest of this post is
          essentially a retroactive justification of my feelings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we talk about the material or the broader design principles we
          use at
          <a

            >Rubato Guitars</a
          >, I should explain my assessment of the current electric guitar
          industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          In short, it is: conservative, unable/afraid to move away from old
          instrument designs, and tied to wood for sentimental reasons. This is
          sad. As far as instruments go, the electric guitar is almost
          brand-new<a href="#1" class="align-top text-xs text-stone-400">[1]</a
          >. In it’s heyday (the era of guitar heroes), there was a sense of
          innovation and progress, now it’s a lot of nostalgia and some
          snake-oil.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way I see it, if the electric guitar were to be invented today
          there is little chance it would be made out of wood.
          <em>Especially</em> not the woods that are commonplace in the
          industry. These are of a different time. Wood is heavy and unreliable,
          it’s primary redeeming factor is that it’s cheap<a
            href="#2"
            class="align-top text-xs text-stone-400"
            >[2]</a
          >. It is so susceptible to changes in the weather that a massive metal
          rod has to be installed down the centre of a guitar’s neck to fight
          the uncooperative material. All this means no two wood electric
          guitars will feel the same or play the same, even if they come off the
          line one after the other.
        </p>

          Guitarists have deemed this unreliability a good thing. If you try a
          bunch of guitars you will eventually find “the one” and it will be
          magical. There are a few problems with this. Firstly, this implies
          that there are a lot of guitars being produced which are duds (or at
          least sub-par)—this is clearly bad<a
            href="#3"
            class="align-top text-xs text-stone-400"
            >[3]</a
          >. If they aren’t coming out right, then you find out what’s causing
          the defects and fix it at the source—especially if the thing you’re
          selling is thousands of dollars. Rolex don’t send out a bunch of
          watches that don’t keep time or have slightly skew hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          I actually think the luxury watch analogy here is quite appropriate.
          They’re nowhere near the best way to keep time, they make a big deal
          of their history, and the enthusiasts are obsessive. Part of their
          world consists vintage watches and historically accurate re-issues.
          But a far larger part of that world is modern horology. This stays
          true to the “essence” of what the community sees as a watch: springs
          and cogs. As long as they use springs and cogs, there are plenty of
          enthusiasts happy for the makers to go wild with modern materials,
          production processes and designs. Maybe they’re trying to keep time as
          best/elegantly as possible without digital assistance, maybe they just
          want new, nice things, whatever—it’s clear that they don’t only want
          the same old thing over and over again.
        </p>
        <p>
          So for guitarists, the question is: what do you believe is the
          “essence” of an electric guitar? I think it’s something with strings
          and frets that you plug into an amp to make noise. How critical is
          wood in this equation?
        </p>
        <p>
          There will always be the vintage stalwarts. I think this is a good
          thing. BMW doesn’t look down on classic car enthusiasts, because
          classic cars are cool. However, they don’t base their new production
          lines on approaches they used in the 60’s. They’ll take design
          inspiration from the old stuff, but they’re not going to use drum
          brakes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Les Pauls and Strats are iconic. We love their sound and we want to be
          like our guitar heroes. But, when we know don’t have to, why should we
          inherit their limitations?
